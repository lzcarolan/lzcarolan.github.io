<h4> Hi!</h4>
<p> My full name is Elizabeth Antoine Carolan, but I usually go by Lizzie.
I was born in Minneapolis, MN but moved to Montreal, QC, Canada in 2011 to attend McGill University.
In 2014, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Linguisitcs. Currently, I work as a research assistant in the Linguistics Department
as well as at the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders. I have a passion for both theoretical linguistics research as well as clinical research. When I'm not doing research, I enjoy cooking, reading novels, listening to all sorts of music, biking, and rock climbing!</p>
